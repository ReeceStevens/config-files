config-files
============

These are my configuration files for Arch/Ubuntu/MacOSX. 
This includes .screenrc, .vimrc, and rc.lua (for the Awesome window manager).
I have two different rc.lua files, one for a Lenovo Thinkpad X200 (tried and
true, tested in Africa!) and one for a MacBook Pro Retina.

While `vimrc` is retained for the sake of tracking my "vanilla" vim config, the
neovim configuration is my daily driver.
